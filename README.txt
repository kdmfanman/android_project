In the Geocoding folder you will find our Android app. Our android app does the following things:

1) Displays a map, text box, and two buttons
2) Allows the user to enter an address in the text box and push a submit button. The map camera then centers and zooms on the respective location on the map. A marker is also placed on this location and the address displayed to the user.

(Bonus functionality)
3) A button on the bottom left of the app allows the user to cycle through the type of view of the map (Regular, Satellite, Hybrid).

We completed the bare minimum functionality of the app and added one additional (simple) feature. For this reason, we believe that we deserve 85 points for the bare minimum app, and an additional 5 points for the view changing functionality. Ultimately, we believe we deserve 90 points in total for our app.
